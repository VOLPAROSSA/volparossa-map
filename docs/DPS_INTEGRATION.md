# DPS location integration boundary

This document maps the shared VOLPAROSSA positioning service (DPS) to Organic
Maps' pinned native location inputs. It records integration seams, not an
implemented adapter or evidence of improved positioning. The core design is
[`DPS.md` at core PR #299 candidate `4e673a5a`](https://github.com/VOLPAROSSA/volparossa/blob/4e673a5a5a9b0c3ad08325999496b72461ba301a/docs/services/DPS.md).
The corrected contract uses request field 64 and response field 64, retaining
local-control envelope version 2 and DPS schema version 1. The initial prototype's
request 46/response 34 overlapped retained Storage interfaces and are superseded
without DPS aliases. Consumers must not implement those prototype assignments.

Earlier source `1fd9397e` passes Quality `39612903195`, including 17 DPS tests,
and CodeQL `39612896634`; those results do not accept the corrected allocation.
The pinned candidate requires its own Quality `39616727891` and CodeQL
`39616721234` results. It is not a merged-main guarantee, and no native Map
integration has been accepted. The core ledger preserves the initial build,
lockfile and lint failures alongside subsequent evidence.

## Existing native inputs

All source pointers below are pinned to Organic Maps
[`b20d1417eef1e3c63a447ac8658db4307a066024`](UPSTREAM.md).

- **Android acquisition and lifecycle:**
  [`LocationHelper`](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/b20d1417eef1e3c63a447ac8658db4307a066024/android/sdk/src/main/java/app/organicmaps/sdk/location/LocationHelper.java)
  filters inactive, stale and lower-quality fixes, manages listeners and
  timeout, and forwards ordinary fixes through `LocationState.nativeLocationUpdated`.
  `LocationProviderFactory` selects GMS or `AndroidNativeProvider`; leave that
  OS-provider selection and lifecycle intact. Permission requests remain in
  the app (`MwmActivity.onMyPositionModeChanged`) and must explicitly cover any
  new sensor access.
- **Android JNI conversion:**
  [`LocationState.java`](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/b20d1417eef1e3c63a447ac8658db4307a066024/android/sdk/src/main/java/app/organicmaps/sdk/location/LocationState.java)
  and [`LocationState.cpp`](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/b20d1417eef1e3c63a447ac8658db4307a066024/android/sdk/src/main/cpp/app/organicmaps/sdk/LocationState.cpp)
  convert a platform fix to `GpsInfo`, label it `EAndroidNative`, and send it
  to routing and `GpsTracker`. Do not disguise DPS results as Android
  `Location` objects or send them through this callback. Add a separately typed
  source/quality seam during native implementation.
- **iOS acquisition and lifecycle:**
  [`MWMLocationManager.mm`](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/b20d1417eef1e3c63a447ac8658db4307a066024/iphone/Maps/Core/Location/MWMLocationManager.mm)
  owns `CLLocationManager`, authorization, app activity and accepted location
  delivery. `location_util::gpsInfoFromLocation` converts accepted
  `CLLocation`s; the manager forwards them to routing, observers and
  `GpsTracker`. Keep this manager and its OS permission/status behavior intact.
- **Common consumer:** `Framework::OnLocationUpdate(GpsInfo)` feeds routing;
  route matching and `MyPositionController` use `horizontalAccuracy` for
  matching and the visible error circle. `Framework::GetCurrentPosition`
  exposes only a projected point and loses quality metadata, so it is not a
  sufficient DPS input/output boundary.

## Data, trust and lifecycle requirements

`GpsInfo` represents latitude/longitude in degrees, altitude in metres,
horizontal/vertical accuracy in metres, bearing clockwise from true north,
speed in m/s, and a Unix-epoch timestamp in seconds. Its `m_source` enum identifies
the existing source class, but it lacks coordinate-frame/altitude-datum and
DPS-specific provenance, correlation, integrity or conflict fields. The core contract
uses WGS84 ECEF XYZ in metres or an explicitly named local Cartesian frame.
Conversion to Map geodetic coordinates therefore needs a tested WGS84
ellipsoid transform and an explicit altitude-datum policy. A local frame needs
a known origin, orientation and epoch plus a tested transform; reject unknown
or incomparable frames. Never relabel ECEF or local coordinates as latitude
and longitude. Caller-supplied frame and source claims are not independently
verified by DPS.

Carry DPS provenance, age, integrity/conflict and its consistency radius in a
separate typed quality result. Do not present the radius as calibrated
probability or silently map it to OS `horizontalAccuracy`. The current core
candidate can return an input position only as explicitly unverified; it does
not fuse or manufacture a more accurate fix. Keep Map's OS provider and
lifecycle available, but select a displayed fix through an explicit policy that
shows unresolved integrity, age and uncertainty. A conflicting GNSS input must not
become a silently trusted OS fallback. If neither source is suitable, report
unavailability rather than silently substituting or retaining a suspect claim.

Any future consumer must be an optional, app-owned, least-authority adapter to
reusable core logic. The core agent's Unix control socket is administrative
and must not be exposed to the mobile app. Do not duplicate the estimator or
override platform location providers. DPS selection, sensing, contribution
and persistence require separate explicit permissions/consent. Do not route a
DPS result to `GpsTracker` or `TrackRecorder`, or retain it as movement history,
unless the existing independent recording choice explicitly authorizes that
recording. Revocation and expiry must clear the app's DPS-selected state.

## Scope and acceptance stages

Investigate optional supplementary location for weak GNSS, tunnels and indoor
settings, robust positioning and GNSS-manipulation detection. Keep offline
navigation functional, make uncertainty visible, and never share routes or
movement history automatically. This scope is research and staged validation,
not a claim that these environments are already solved.

1. **Synthetic:** test frame conversion, units, altitude handling, bounds,
   stale/expiry, conflict, source provenance, unavailable results and consent
   revocation. Verify OS fixes remain usable and no route/history is published.
2. **Native app:** add an explicitly selected DPS input on Android and iOS
   without changing OS provider or permission behavior. Exercise lifecycle,
   source switching, quality display, expiry and offline navigation in actual
   native builds/devices. Source tests alone do not establish this acceptance.
3. **Hardware evidence:** test named sensor/platform adapters against
   independent reference measurements and controlled fault injection. Report
   simulated results, working hardware trials and demonstrated positioning
   gains separately. Never perform unauthorized radio scans or GNSS
   interference, or change host location/network settings.

Lawful bounded hardware/estimator research may proceed alongside native
integration; the stages distinguish evidence, not a mandatory build order.
